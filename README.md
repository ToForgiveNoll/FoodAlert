Update of Mehnis mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1114619043

- Added a setting for selecting the lowest preferability of food to be counted
	DesperateOnly,RawBad,RawTasty,MealAwful,MealSimple,MealFine,MealLavish
	Examples for each category shows in the config-dialog
- Changed the calculations for food, instead using the exact amount the pawns require
	This should make the mod show more correct values and also ignore pawns that do not eat
- Russian translation fixed by Morbo
- Added compatibility with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1909914131]SOS2
- Italian translation by arl85
- Spanish translation by Ferchu
